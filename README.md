## üöÄ About The Project

**SubDupes** is a forthcoming SaaS product designed to help users find, track, and cancel their recurring subscriptions and "shadow charges."

Its primary competitive advantage is a **privacy-first model**. Unlike competitors (like Rocket Money or Trim), our V1 works *without* requiring users to connect their sensitive bank accounts via Plaid. Instead, it builds a comprehensive dashboard using a secure email scanner (for receipts) and a smart browser extension (for tracking new signups).

This repository holds the code for the `index.html` waitlist/coming-soon page. This page was built to validate the business idea, showcase the core value propositions, and collect interest from early adopters via a waitlist form.

## ‚ú® Key Features (as advertised on the page)

The SubDupes V1 product is designed to be a complete subscription "manager," not just a "tracker."

* **Privacy-First Discovery:** No bank connection (Plaid) required.
* **Smart Email Scan:** Securely scans your inbox (Gmail/Outlook) for receipts to find existing subs.
* **Browser Extension:** A smart companion that detects when you sign up for a new trial.
* **Concierge Cancellation:** A "Cancel for Me" button where a human team member handles the entire cancellation process for you.
* **Free Trial Alerts:** A 48-hour alert before a free trial converts to a paid plan.
* **Duplicate & Price Hike Detection:** Automatically flags "SubDupes" (duplicate subscriptions) and price increases found in receipts.
* **Visual Spending Dashboard:** A clean, graphical UI to see your spending by category.

## üíª Built With

This landing page is intentionally lightweight, fast, and dependency-free.

* **HTML5:** For semantic and accessible structure.
* **CSS3 (Vanilla):** For all styling, layout (Flexbox/Grid), animations, and a fully responsive design.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Used only for the mobile hamburger menu and the placeholder `alert()` on form submission.
* **No Frameworks:** No React, Vue, Bootstrap, or Tailwind. Just one self-contained, easy-to-deploy `index.html` file.

## üìù Next Steps for This Repo (TODO)

This landing page is a starting point. The next steps are to make the waitlist functional:

* [ ] **Connect Waitlist Form:** The email form currently shows a simple `alert()`. This needs to be connected to a real service.
    * **Easy:** Use a service like [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/) (if hosting there), [Formspree](https://formspree.io/), or [Getform](https://getform.io/).
    * **Advanced:** Connect it to your email marketing tool (e.g., Mailchimp, ConvertKit) or a custom API endpoint that saves to a database.
* [ ] **Add Analytics:** Add a tracking script (e.g., Google Analytics, Plausible, or Fathom) to measure visits and conversions.
* [ ] **Add Screenshot:** Take a high-quality screenshot of the final page and add it to the top of this `README`.
